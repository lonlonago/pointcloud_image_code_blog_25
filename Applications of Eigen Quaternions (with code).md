##  First, the definition of quaternions 

>  A PDF about the explanation of quaternions An excellent blog about quaternions A quaternion derivation summarized by myself 

##  First, the quaternion type 

 Common quaternion formats include Quaternionf (float) and Quaterniond (double), and Scalar in the template class determines the data type.

>  Note: The order of quaternions in Eigen is [w, x, y, z], with the real number w at the beginning; but in fact its internal storage order is [x y z w], and the output coefficients are also output in the internal storage order [x y z w]. 

##  Quaternion assignment 

 The official introduction has seven construction methods, but the commonly used ones are generally as follows:
