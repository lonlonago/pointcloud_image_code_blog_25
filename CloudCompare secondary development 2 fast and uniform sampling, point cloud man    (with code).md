#  I. Overview 

   For the algorithm principle of fast uniform sampling, see: PCL fast uniform sampling. Do not rely on any third-party library to directly use CLoudCompare implementation. 

#  Second, code integration 

 1. Add to the mainwindow.h file public: 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574110046
  ```  
 2, mainwindow.cpp file void Main Window :: connect Actions () function to add: 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574110046
  ```  
 Note: actionFastUniformSample the name of the new button on the interface, and set the button and name according to your own needs! 3. Add the implementation code in the mainwindow.cpp file: 

  ```python
