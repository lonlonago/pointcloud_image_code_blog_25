   The polygon dataset vtkPolyData consists of vertices, polyvertices, lines, polylines, and triangular zones. Vertices, lines, and polygons form the smallest set of basic elements used to express geometric shapes in 0, 1, and 2 dimensions. .vtk to .pcd is to extract the vertices and polyvertices in vtkPolyData and save them as point clouds.
